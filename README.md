# J-J-PiInTheSky

## Planning

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to use a Raspberry Pi to collect acceleration and vertex data after being launched into the air. 

#### Resources and Constraints
The resources we have available to us for this project are anything from the CHS Sigma Lab and other items we may have to purchase on our own. We also have the help of Dr. Shields, along with all of our classmates amazing brains and ideas. We have pretty much anything we could need to make this project possible, including 3D printers, laser cutters, acrylic, servos, screws, and many other things. However, we need to keep our resources in check in order to not waste materials. The biggest constraint that we will face throughout this project is time. We will need to work quickly and diligently in order to finish the project completely in time.
