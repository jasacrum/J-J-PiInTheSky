# J-J-PiInTheSky

## Planning

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to use a Raspberry Pi to collect acceleration and vertex data after being launched into the air. 

#### Resources and Constraints
The resources we have available to us for this project are anything from the CHS Sigma Lab and other items we may have to purchase on our own. We also have the help of Dr. Shields, along with all of our classmates amazing brains and ideas. We have pretty much anything we could need to make this project possible, including 3D printers, laser cutters, acrylic, servos, screws, and many other things. However, we need to keep our resources in check in order to not waste materials. The biggest constraint that we will face throughout this project is time. We will need to work quickly and diligently in order to finish the project completely in time. 

#### Initial Design
Our initial design for this project consists of an enclosure made out foam board. This enclosure will hold all of the components of our project in place. On top of the enclosure a parachute will be attached to slow down the fall of the Pi while it descends back to the ground. Future additions may include putting the parachute into a cap that, when it is at the vertext of it's flight, releases the parachute out. This would stand in place of just having the parachute freely attached to the top.

#### Documentation

| Date | What We Accomplished |
| --- | --- |
| 2-18-19 | This week we started to construct our walls in Solid Works |
| 2-25-19 | We finished our walls and assembled the box on Solid Works |
| 3-4-19  | This week we laser cut out walls, printed our parachute holders, and assembled the box to make sure it worked. It seems a little heavier than we wanted it to be, but with the right parachute, it will work perfectly. Update, we are going to use a parachute from istem people|
| 3-11-19 | The box was comletely assembled already and we did not need to make any corrections so we started to test different parachutes. At first we tried one parachute made out of an extremely large coffee filter, but that did not work. After that we tried to add four little parachutes to help, but that also didn't work. As of now we have one coffee filter parachute and one nylon parachute attached, which also did not work, but we are are going to get another nylon 'chute to help. |
