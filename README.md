# J-J-PiInTheSky

## Planning

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to use a Raspberry Pi to collect acceleration and vertex data after being launched into the air. 

#### Resources and Constraints
The resources we have available to us for this project are anything from the CHS Sigma Lab and other items we may have to purchase on our own. We also have the help of Dr. Shields, along with all of our classmates amazing brains and ideas. We have pretty much anything we could need to make this project possible, including 3D printers, laser cutters, acrylic, servos, screws, and many other things. However, we need to keep our resources in check in order to not waste materials. The biggest constraint that we will face throughout this project is time. We will need to work quickly and diligently in order to finish the project completely in time. 

#### Initial Design
Our initial design for this project consists of an enclosure made out foam board. This enclosure will hold all of the components of our project in place. On top of the enclosure a parachute will be attached to slow down the fall of the Pi while it descends back to the ground. Future additions may include putting the parachute into a cap that, when it is at the vertext of it's flight, releases the parachute out. This would stand in place of just having the parachute freely attached to the top.
